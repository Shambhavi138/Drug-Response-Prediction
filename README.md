Drug Response Prediction Model
Overview
This repository contains a machine learning model to predict the appropriate medication for patients suffering from a specific illness based on their demographic and health data. The model utilizes a decision tree classifier trained on a dataset of patients who responded to one of five medications: Drug A, Drug B, Drug C, Drug X, and Drug Y.

Dataset
The dataset comprises patient records with the following features:

Age
Sex
Blood Pressure
Cholesterol
Each patient in the dataset is labeled with the medication they responded to, which serves as the target variable for the classification task.

Methodology
The model development process involves:

Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
Model training: Building a decision tree classifier using the training data.
Model evaluation: Assessing the performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Prediction: Using the trained model to predict the appropriate medication for new patients based on their features.
